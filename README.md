## 🚀 About Me
As an assistant lecturer at the physics department in Sohag University, I have been teaching courses related to physics and software engineering. Additionally, my experience as a software engineer has allowed me to work on various projects that involve developing innovative solutions using technology.

One of the most notable projects that I have worked on is the development of a smart robot that can detect radioactive contamination and measure radiation doses. This project was honored by his excellency the President of the republic, Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, and we won the 1st place at (ISEIC′23). The project consists of a radiation detector, a radiation alarm, and a smart robot that can navigate through contaminated areas and provide real-time data about radiation levels.

Another project that I have worked on is the development of a smart talking calculator for blinds. This calculator takes inputs with Braille numbers and gives outputs as voice, making it easier for visually impaired individuals to perform calculations.

In addition to these projects, I have also worked on developing a smart eye identifier. This is a monitoring system that can record the attendance and departure of students and employees, with the ability to send warnings to those who exceed permitted absence rates.

Finally, as part of my ITI diploma graduation project, I developed a website using WordPress called Visit Sohag. This website aims to promote tourism in Sohag by providing information about tourist attractions in the city.
